# ðŸŽ® Hangman Game Challenge

Welcome to the Hangman Game coding challenge! In this assignment, you'll build a classic word-guessing game using Python. This project will help you strengthen your skills with strings, loops, conditionals, and user inputâ€”all while having fun.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to manipulate strings and lists in Python
- Practice using loops and conditionals to control program flow
- Learn to select random items from a list
- Gain experience with user input and feedback

## Assignment Overview

You will create a Hangman game where the player tries to guess a hidden word, one letter at a time. The game ends when the player either successfully guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

## Requirements

Your game should:

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list
- Accept single-letter guesses from the player
- Display the current progress (e.g., _ _ a _ _ _)
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game with a win or lose message

## Starter Code

You can use the provided `starter-code.py` file to help you get started. Feel free to modify and expand it as needed.

## Tips for Success

- Use clear variable names and comments to explain your code
- Test your game with different words and edge cases
- Have fun and be creative with your messages and word list!
